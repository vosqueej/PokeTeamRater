This bash script is meant to check a given team's defensive weaknesses, and in the future the type coverage of their attacks.
I would love to eventually refer to Smogon or something and tell them which sets in particular they are weak to (DD Mence vs Mixmence as an example).

Features:
Takes input as a list of Pokemon. Does not consider moves, EVs, IVs, abilities, items, etc.
Type conventions:
Normal -> NRM
Fire -> FIR
Fighting -> FGT
Water -> WTR
Flying -> FLY
Grass -> GRS
Poison -> POI
Electric -> ELE
Ground -> GRD
Psychic -> PSY
Rock -> RCK
Ice -> ICE
Bug -> BUG
Dragon -> DRG
Ghost -> GST
Dark -> DRK
Steel -> STL
Fairy -> FAI

This calculator is current to the 6th generation of Pokemon games (X/Y). All Pokemon from previous games who had changed types have had their types listed as the most recent one (eg. Clefairy is a Fairy type, not a Normal type).
Current version only works for the first generation of Pokemon, that is from National dex 001 to 151, however it will be easy to implement later generations.

Pokelist is written in the form of one Pokemon per line, with formatting
PokemonName,TYPE1/TYPE2
If the Pokemon only has one type, then the format will be
PokemonName,TYPE1
